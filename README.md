Breaking Sir Samuel Morland's New Method of Cryptography

## Installation

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script from the shell to decrypt the provided ciphertext using the provided word list:

```bash
python main.py WORD-LIST CIPHERTEXT
```

- `WORD-LIST`: Path to a word-frequency list (e.g., `data/word-list/eng-gb.txt`).
- `CIPHERTEXT`: Path to a ciphertext file (e.g., `data/ciphertext/morland-page01.txt`). Tokens in the ciphertext file should be separated by spaces to detect multi-character tokens. Line breaks are treated as spaces but otherwise do not matter.

## Example

```bash
python main.py data/word-list/eng-gb.txt data/ciphertext/morland-page01.txt
```
