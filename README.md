Breaking Sir Samuel Morland's New Method of Cryptography

This project is inspired by the National Archives blog post "[Hidden in plain sight: an undeciphered letter from Louis XIV’s France](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/explore-the-collection/the-collection-blog/undeciphered-letter-from-louis-xivs-france/)". The post highlights an enciphered message that William Perwich, an English diplomat, sent to the court of Charles II in 1670.

The method of encryption is not known, but it could be one of the methods published by Sir Samuel Morland in his paper "[A New Method of Cryptography](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_a-new-method-of-cryptogr_morland-sir-samuel_1666)", a few years earlier in 1666.

While Morland also presents methods that utilise non-rectangular patterns, he focuses on methods that are based on columnar transposition of a rectangular grid.

To illustrate the difficulty of deciphering the message without the key, Morland correctly states that encrypting a message of 81 characters on a 3x27 grid results in 27! (more than ten octillion) possible keys.

However, by using techniques developed since 1666, we can break Morland's method and possibly decrypt Perwich's message.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This project was developed in Python 3.13. Older versions may work but have not been checked.

## Usage

Run the main script from the shell to decrypt the provided ciphertext using the provided word list:

```bash
python main.py WORD-LIST CIPHERTEXT
```

- `WORD-LIST`: Path to a word-frequency list (e.g., `data/word-list/eng-gb.txt`).
- `CIPHERTEXT`: Path to a ciphertext file (e.g., `data/ciphertext/morland-page01.txt`). Tokens in the ciphertext file should be separated by spaces to detect multi-character tokens. Line breaks are treated as spaces but otherwise do not matter.

## Example

```bash
python main.py data/word-list/eng-gb.txt data/ciphertext/morland-page01.txt
```

## Method
